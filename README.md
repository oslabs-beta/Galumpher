# Galumpher

A Podman monitoring tool built on electron

## Summary 

Galumpher is an open-source developer tool to help monitor the health and status of your Podman containers
that are currently running on your local machine. Galumpher allows users to view important metrics at a quick glance
and update them at the click of a button.

## Features

- Galumpher will display all of the containers that are currently running on the machine in the dropdown menu located in the sidebar. 
- The main metrics page will display the metrics of the first container on the list by default.
- Clicking on a different container within the dropdown will automatically fetch the most recent metrics for
that container and load them into the metrics display section.
- Key metrics currently available are CPU usage, memory usage, and net input/output.
- All figures are displayed in MB.
